# PLEASE CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THIS PROJECT FOLDER BEFORE RUNNING ANY FILES



# How to create an virtual environment?

Before running the project, it is recommended to create a virtual environment within the project folder to isolate dependencies.

## macOS/Linux

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


## Windows/Powershell

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1



## Installing Dependencies

After activating the virtual environment, install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt









## Note

Make sure to add `venv/` to `.gitignore` so the virtual environment is not committed to the repository.
